    /// <see cref="Behavior"/> is a specification of how its context <see cref="BehavioredClassifier"/> changes state over time. This specification may be either a definition of possible behavior execution or emergent behavior, or a selective illustration of an interesting subset of possible executions. The latter form is typically used for capturing examples, such as a trace of a particular execution.

A <see cref="Behavior"/> that is directly owned as a nestedClassifier does not have a context. Otherwise, to determine the context of a <see cref="Behavior"/>, find the first <see cref="BehavioredClassifier"/> reached by following the chain of owner relationships from the <see cref="Behavior"/>, if any. If there is such a <see cref="BehavioredClassifier"/>, then it is the context, unless it is itself a <see cref="Behavior"/> with a non-empty context, in which case that is also the context for the original <see cref="Behavior"/>. For example, following this algorithm, the context of an entry <see cref="Behavior"/> in a <see cref="StateMachine"/> is the <see cref="BehavioredClassifier"/> that owns the <see cref="StateMachine"/>. The features of the context <see cref="BehavioredClassifier"/> as well as the <see cref="Element"/>s visible to the context <see cref="Classifier"/> are visible to the <see cref="Behavior"/>.
