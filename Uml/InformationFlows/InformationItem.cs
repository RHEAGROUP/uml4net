    /// <see cref="InformationItem"/>s represent many kinds of information that can flow from sources to targets in very abstract ways.  They represent the kinds of information that may move within a system, but do not elaborate details of the transferred information.  Details of transferred information are the province of other <see cref="Classifier"/>s that may ultimately define <see cref="InformationItem"/>s.  Consequently, <see cref="InformationItem"/>s cannot be instantiated and do not themselves have features, generalizations, or associations. An important use of <see cref="InformationItem"/>s is to represent information during early design stages, possibly before the detailed modeling decisions that will ultimately define them have been made. Another purpose of <see cref="InformationItem"/>s is to abstract portions of complex models in less precise, but perhaps more general and communicable, ways.
